Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹ I'm @backina-g0d
# About Me
I'm a beginner in coding with a strong interest in Linux, system hardening, and local AI training.
My focus is on learning AI/ML workflows, from data processing to model 
optimization, while maintaining a security-first mindset.
# Key Interests
Debian-based Linux: Daily driver for development and experimentation.
System Hardening: Applying security best practices to Linux environments.
Local AI Training: Exploring LLMs, fine-tuning, and efficient inference on consumer hardware.
# Current Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯
AI/ML Fundamentals: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and quantization techniques (GGUF, LoRA, etc.).
 Automation: Python/Bash scripting for reproducible AI/ML workflows.
 Privacy-Focused AI: Self-hosted models, data anonymization, and secure training pipelines.
# Projects
Small-scale AI experiments (local LLMs, dataset preprocessing).
Linux hardening scripts (focus on Debian/Ubuntu).
Open-source contributions to privacy/security tools.
# Tools & Stack
OS: Debian/Ubuntu (primary), occasionally Arch.
Languages: Python, Bash.
ML Tools: Ollama, Hugging Face, vLLM, etc.
