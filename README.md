# About Me
I'm a Linux user who learned cybersecurity the hard way. Been a Linux user since, specializing in Newtorking, System Hardening, and recently branching off 
into local AI training & LLM fine-tuning, as well as coding.
My focus is on learning AI/ML workflows, from data processing to model 
optimization, while trying to learn a few coding languages to make some lives better. 
# Key Interests
Debian-based Linux: Daily driver for development and experimentation.
System Hardening: Applying security best practices to Linux environments.
Local AI Training: Exploring LLMs, fine-tuning, and efficient inference on consumer hardware.
# Current Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯
Mental Health, Addiction Recovery, and Grief Data Research
AI/ML Fundamentals: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and quantization techniques (GGUF, LoRA, etc.).
 Automation: Python/Bash scripting for reproducible AI/ML workflows.
 Privacy-Focused AI: Self-hosted models, data anonymization, and secure training pipelines.
# Projects
Hobbyest Web Development
Small-scale AI experiments (local LLMs, dataset preprocessing).
Linux hardening scripts (focus on Debian/Ubuntu).
Open-source contributions to privacy/security tools.
# Tools & Stack
OS: Debian/Ubuntu (primary), occasionally Arch.
Languages: Python, Bash, React, Node.js, Java, 
ML Tools: Ollama, Huggingface, etc.
